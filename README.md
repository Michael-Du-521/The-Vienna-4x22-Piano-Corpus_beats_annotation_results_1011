The Vienna 4x22 Piano Corpus_beats_annotation_results_1011

We operated beats annotation on the classical music datasets: The Vienna 4x22 Piano Corpus. In the beat annotation stage, in order to reach a certain level annotation accuracy, we applied the two-stage beat annotation process suggested by the [Li, 2016], and each round of beats annotation was executed six-times, each time included manually tapping and adjusting based on the onset detection plugin in Sonic Visualizer. The beats annotation results were the means of all the six round beat annotation data. After that we do once double-check to make sure there are no personal errors.
